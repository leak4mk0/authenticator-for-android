This project is an older fork of the one on the Play store. It's an older
version that doesn't get changes synced to it from the Play store version.

Description
-----------
The Google Authenticator project includes implementations of one-time passcode
generators for several mobile platforms, as well as a pluggable authentication
module (PAM). One-time passcodes are generated using open standards developed by
the [Initiative for Open Authentication (OATH)](http://www.openauthentication.org/)
(which is unrelated to [OAuth](http://oauth.net/ OAuth)). 

This project contains the Android app. All other apps, and the PAM module, are in
[a separate project](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator).

This implementation supports the HMAC-Based One-time Password (HOTP) algorithm
specified in [RFC 4226](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226) and the Time-based
One-time Password (TOTP) algorithm specified in [RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238).

Further documentation is available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki).

Difference

This fork supports SONY SmartWatch 2.
